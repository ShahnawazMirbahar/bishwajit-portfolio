## Overview

Codebase for [https://jpvalery.photo](https://jpvalery.photo) my photography portfolio.
Current iteration is built using Next.js + TailwindCSS and pulls content from Contentful. It was launched in March 2021.

### Features

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Contentful
- Analytics w/ [Umami](https://umami.is)
- Hosted on Vercel

##### Notes

> Code can be used as a reference for other projects but won't work out of the box without replicating Contentful schema.

> Inspire yourself and tinker all you want, just give credit and don't do a mindless copy-paste.

> Previous iteration was built using Contentful, Netlify, and Gatsby V2; and was launched in January 2019. Based on [@iammatthias/.com](https://github.com/iammatthias/.com). Without Matthias' work, I'll still be on format or whatever service.
